"AutoX Technologies, Inc.",AVT021,Jul 22 2019,3LN6L5MU5JR618391,No,Yes,Test Driver,Street,Planning Discrepancy: Autonomous vehicle is approaching the intersection while a front vehicle has already stopped at the stop line for the red light. The lane is very wide (as wide as two lanes) which caused the autonomous vehicle to decide to maneuver to the right side of the front vehicle and stop in parallel to it. This behavior was perceived to be overly aggressive by the safety driver therefore he disengaged the system as it started maneuvering to the right.
